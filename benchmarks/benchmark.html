<p>The stat_agg package was intented to be used for an ensemble of heterogeneous learners. It should be noted that this is slightly different than the ensemble learners provided in packages like sklearn, where each learner resamples a single data set and/or the parameters for each learner are varied. stat_agg makes no assumptions about either the learners or the data sets from which the predictions are calculated. It only assumes that predictions are for the same outcome. Furthermore, we are not aware of other packages of this kind. We speculate that statistical aggregation of heterogeneous learners is generally done ad-hoc and part of the intention of this package is to leverage sklearn for both the creation of the individual learners as well as their aggregate prediction.</p>
<p>As a result,the benchmarks here show the performance for a simple use case; namely, prediction airline delays. The data set used will be 2008 flight delay information for those carriers with at least 1% commercial U.S. domestic flights. The data set contains information for 7,009,729 flights. Each flight contains 29 variables related to flight time, delay time, departure airport, arrival airport, and so on.</p>

<p>All scripts required to run the benchmarks are available in the <a href="https://github.com/kaneplusplus/stat_agg/tree/master/benchmarks">stat_agg repository</a>. The directory contains:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><a href="https://github.com/kaneplusplus/stat_agg/blob/master/benchmarks/make_data.r">make_data.r</a> - an R script for downloading the data, creating training and test data, fitting the learners (for both regression and classification), and outputting their predictions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kaneplusplus/stat_agg/blob/master/benchmarks/benchmark_regression.py">benchmark_regression.py</a> - a Python script that runs the regression benchmarks.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kaneplusplus/stat_agg/blob/master/benchmarks/benchmark_classification.py">benchmark_classification.py</a> - a Python script that runs the classification benchmarks.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kaneplusplus/stat_agg/blob/master/benchmarks/benchmark.rmd">benchmark.rmd</a> - an R markdown file for generating this file.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create the files needed for the benchmark you can simply either source make_data.r or call it from the terminal.</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark-datasets">The Benchmark Datasets</h2>
<p>The following data sets are created when the make_data.r script is run:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>regression_predictions_train.csv - the in-sample predictions of the departure delay of 6 learners. All learners were fitted using a random subset of 5 variables and least squares regression.</li>
<li>regression_predictions_test.csv - out of sample predictions of the departure delay and a extra column giving the actual departure delay.</li>
<li>classification_prediction_train.csv - the in-sample predictions of whether or not a flight was at left late (the departure delay is greater than or equal to 15 minutes) of 6 learners. All learners were fitted using a random subset of 5 variables and all were fitted using logistic regression.</li>
<li>classification_prediction_test.csv - out of sample predictions of late departures and an extra column giving the actual departure delay.</li>
</ul>

<p>The benchmark_classification.py script benchmarks the aggregation of classification predictions using minimum variance. The package is trained on a data set where each of the learners is represented. However, if variables are not present for the prediction, whether it is because the learner is not available or because it is taking too long, the internal weighting of the learners is recalculated. The timing can be reproduced by by running the script.</p>

<p>The plot above shows the misclassification rate of the aggregates in the number of learners. The horizontal red line shows the best classfication rate of any individual learner. In general the accuracy first increases but past a given point, more learners may actually decrease accuracy. As a result the number of learners must be tuned for the application. However, when tuned they generally provide accuracy well beyond the accuracy of any given predictor.</p>

<p>The benchmark_regression.py script benchmarks the aggregation of continuous predictions using least squares. The package is trained on a data set where each of the learners is represented. However, if variables are not present for the prediction, whether it is because the learner is not available or because it is taking too long, the internal weighting of the learners is recalculated. The timing for least squares can be tested simply by running the script.</p>
